# Mastermind
1st semester project.

This is a simple code breaking game called mastermind.
The aim of the game is to guess a secret computer generated colour coded sequence with the help of hints.
The black peg means correct colour in correct position while the white peg means correct colour but wrong position.

It is implemented  using  Tkinter python that has a very user friendly GUI.


To run the game dowload all the files from this repository and run intropage.py
